I finally found the solution here: https://serverok.in/systemd-resolved

In case the link die in the future: Create a file:

sudo mkdir /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_servers.conf
Add my dns in this file:

[Resolve]
DNS=8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1
Then restart systemd-resolved

sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
It works even after reboot :-)
