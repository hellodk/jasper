#### SAST
SAST (Static Application Security Testing) and SCA (Software Composition Analysis) are both tools used for identifying security vulnerabilities in software. However, they differ in how they go about this process:

SAST (Static Application Security Testing) analyzes the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This can include things like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure use of encryption. Because SAST analyzes the source code, it can be used early in the development process, before the application is deployed.

#### SCA
SCA (Software Composition Analysis) analyzes the dependencies and third-party components of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This can include things like known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries and frameworks. SCA is typically used after an application is deployed, as a way of identifying vulnerabilities that may have been introduced by third-party components.

In summary, SAST focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the application code itself, while SCA focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the dependencies and third-party components used by the application. Both tools are important for ensuring the security of an application and should be used in conjunction to get a complete overview of the application's vulnerabilities.
